                <p>
                    Iâ€™m a curious Python Bootcamp student (graduating in May 2021) making a transition into an IT career.
                    I discovered my interest in web development while I was working as a project manager at 
                    <a href="https://www.lasering.ee" target="_blank" class="a-color">this</a> amazing company. I was offered the opportunity 
                    to lead the process of rebuilding their website and upgrade their online presence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had no idea that rebuilding a new online store can be as complex, detailed and
                    time-consuming as it was. We were faced with so many challenges along our way but this is what made the whole process captivating 
                    as we had to put our best problem-solving skills to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As stated before, working on their new website made me realize my interest in web development. I had the chance to work closely with their
                    e-commerce development partner and I found myself wondering what do those web developers actually do? How do they build
                    things and turn all those ideas of a client into reality or code rather. So I made a decision to look into this new interest of mine a bit more
                    in detail and see where this road would take me.
                </p>

                    In May 2020, I joined <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> - an online learning platform for coding. 
                    I hopped on board with their Python track and also their Front End Web Development track which I both completed successfully. 
                    As I had found my new passion I wished to take my studies further and enrolled in a 9-month Python bootcamp in September 2020.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside my bootcamp studies I also take the course
                    <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript" target="_blank">"CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript"</a>
                    provided by Harvard University.

                    Here's a short overview of some of the projects/assignments I have completed during my studies:

                            <strong>"Project 0: Search" at Harvard's CS50 online course</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was one very captivating assignment. I had to design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search,
                            and Google Advanced Search. It was also required to submit the code to CS50's GitHub and record a screencast not to exceed
                            5 minutes in length, in which I had to demonstrate my project's functionality. I received a passing grade on this project.

                            This was an assigment given to us by our SQL instructor at my bootcamp. We had to build a dating app that would interact
                            with our user and retrieve data from our MySQL database based on user input. Please see the screencasts for the presentation
                            of my program where I also walk you through my code.

                            I built this program a while back when I started to learn Python. The Estonian identification (ID) code is a unique 11-digit code
                            and it has a set of requirements. This program checks these requirements and makes sure that the ID-code is indeed valid.
                            I have the code on GitHub -> <a href="https://github.com/nurme-ave/ShortPrograms/blob/master/id_code_validator.py" target="_blank">link</a>

                <p>
                    When I joined Treehouse in May 2020 they were promoting this <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" target="_blank">#100DaysOfCode</a> challenge
                    which I had never heard about. After doing some research I decided to join with the challenge. The basic idea is to code 100 days straight and let
                    others know about your progress on social media. I chose Twitter to be that channel I would use to tweet about my progress. I did code and tweeted
                    every day and also tagged Treehouse in my tweets so they could cheer me on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was truly an amazing experience and showed me how much you can achieve by being consistent. Consistency is a powerful tool
                    if you wish to be really good at something. After completing the challenge (on August 31th) I was awarded with a nice badge from Treehouse. I decided to go for a 2nd round of #100DaysOfCode in September and completed it on December 18th.

                <p>I remember very well when I got started with coding and at times found myself clueless doing different challenges at Treehouse. It was good to know that I could always
                    reach out to their supportive online community. At some point I started to feel comfortable with Python and decided it was time I helped out 
                    those students who were new to coding and needed assistance. So this is why I volunteered in the Treehouse Community while I was learning at Treehouse myself. Overall
                    I helped out a bit over 50 students there. It felt so rewarding to get positive feedback from the students I helped!

                    In January 2021 I had the opportunity to volunteer as a mentor in a few Python live seminars organized by the CS50 staff at Harvard University.
                    This was a very unique experience as I did it in real-time when those seminars took place. I had to be quick in catching questions from the students
                    and answering them as there were a lot of students all around the world attending. It was quite an adrenaline rush! Everyone should get out of
                    their comfort zone every once in a while and take on new challenges.
