            <p>
                I hold a degree in law and I have a background in business development with 20 years of experience. I worked for a well-known 
                <a href="https://www.lasering.ee" target="_blank" class="a-color">company</a> in Estonia for a bit over 20 years, helping them to expand their
                business and grow. My main focus was developing their webshop.
            </p>
            <p>
                I held various positions in that company which made it possible for me to grow in my job and climb up the career ladder.
                At some point I felt I had reached the top and needed a career change. After a long consideration I decided to quit my job in
                May 2020 and make a transition into a new career as a software developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I joined <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> - an online learning platform for coding - in May 2020.
                I hopped on board with their Python track which I successfully completed. As I had found my new passion I wished to take my studies
                further and enrolled in a 8-month Python bootcamp in September 2020. Alongside my bootcamp I also take the course
                <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript" target="_blank">"CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript"</a>
                provided by Harvard University and study front end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) at Treehouse.

            <p>
                Here's a short overview of various projects/assignments I have completed during my studies at different providers:
            </p>
            <ol class="project-links">
                <li>
                    <p>"Project 0: Search" at Harvard's CS50 online course</p>
                    <p>
                        This was one very captivating assignment. I had to design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search,
                        and Google Advanced Search. It was also required to submit the code to CS50's GitHub and record a screencast not to exceed
                        5 minutes in length, in which I had to demonstrate my project's functionality. I received a passing grade on this project.
                        The info on this project and details of the requirements can be found

                        This simple page was made as a project when I took a Django course at <a href="https://realpython.com/" target="_blank">RealPython</a>.
                        As deployment was not a part of this course I had to figure it out myself and I deployed the pages with 
                        <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank">Python Anywhere</a>.

            <p>
                When I joined Treehouse in May 2020 they were promoting this <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" target="_blank">#100DaysOfCode</a> challenge
                which I had never heard about. After doing some research I decided to join with the challenge. The basic idea is to code 100 days straight and let
                others know about your progress on social media. I chose Twitter to be that channel I would use to tweet about my progress. I did code and tweeted
                every day and also tagged Treehouse in my tweets so they could cheer me on.
            <p>It was truly an amazing experience and showed me how much you can achieve by being consistent. Consistency is a powerful tool
                if you wish to be really good at something. After completing the challenge (on August 31th) I was awarded with a nice badge from Treehouse (please see
                the image below). I decided to go for a 2nd round of #100DaysOfCode in September and completed it on December 18th.
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>After completing my first round of the #100DaysOfCode challenge I reflected back on the experience and posted some thoughts on this. You can read 
                about it <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ave-nurme_100daysofcode-python-codenewbie-activity-6706307776915804160-P2jK" target="_blank">here.</a>

        <div class="section-content">
            <h2 class="margin-right-3 spacing-headlines">Mentoring</h2>
            <p>I remember very well when I got started with coding and got stuck doing different challenges at Treehouse. It was good to know that I could always
                reach out to their supportive online community. At some point I started to feel really comfortable with Python and decided it was time I helped out 
                those students who were new to coding and needed assistance. So this is why I volunteer in the Treehouse Community every once in a while. Overall
                I have helped out a bit over 50 students there. It feels so rewarding to get positive feedback from the students I've helped!
            </p>
            <p>
                In January 2021 I had the opportunity to volunteer as a mentor in a few online Python seminars organized by the CS50 staff at Harvard University.
                This was a very unique experience as I did it in real-time when those seminars took place. I had to be quick catching questions from the students
                and in answering them as there were a lot of students all around the world attending. It was quite an adrenaline rush! Everyone should get out of
                their comfort zone every once in a while and take on new challenges.
            </p>
