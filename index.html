                <p>
                    I’m a curious Python developer with a positive attitude who believes in self-development as this will keep your mind open
                    and force you out of your comfort zone. Learning new things is never easy but with the right mindset and ‘can-do’ attitude
                    anything is possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my professional life I have learned to solve different complex challenges and how important it is to take care of
                    your team members. I have impeccable work ethics, time management skills and I am a good listener. I value open
                    and honest communication (both in professional and personal life) which will help save everyone’s valuable time and avoid
                    misunderstandings. I am also a fast learner and can pick up new technologies quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I keep myself busy with AWS training and I'm also exploring the data engineering path on DataCamp.

                    it is important to keep things in balance in life.

                        <p>
                            This was one very captivating assignment. I had to design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search,
                            and Google Advanced Search. It was also required to submit the code to CS50's GitHub and record a screencast not to exceed
                            5 minutes in length, in which I had to demonstrate my project's functionality. I received a passing grade on this project.
                            There was no automated check, the project (both the visual side and the code) was checked manually by the CS50 graders.

                <p>
                    When I joined Treehouse in May 2020 they were promoting this <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" rel="noopener">#100DaysOfCode</a> challenge
                    which I had never heard about. After doing some research I decided to join with the challenge. The basic idea is to code 100 days straight and let
                    others know about your progress on social media. I chose Twitter to be that channel I would use to tweet about my progress. I did code and tweeted
                    every day and also tagged Treehouse in my tweets so they could cheer me on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was truly an amazing experience and showed me how much you can achieve by being consistent. Consistency is a powerful tool
                    if you wish to be really good at something. After completing the challenge (on August 31th) I was awarded with a nice badge from Treehouse. I decided to go for a 2nd round of #100DaysOfCode in September and completed it on December 18th.

                    After completing my first round of the #100DaysOfCode challenge I reflected back on the experience and posted some thoughts on this. You can read

                <p>I remember very well when I got started with coding and at times found myself clueless doing different challenges at Treehouse. It was good to know that I could always
                    reach out to their supportive online community. At some point I started to feel comfortable with Python and decided it was time I helped out 
                    those students who were new to coding and needed assistance. So this is why I volunteered in the Treehouse Community while I was learning at Treehouse myself. Overall
                    I helped out a bit over 50 students there. It felt so rewarding to get positive feedback from the students I helped!

                <p>
                    In January 2021 I had the opportunity to volunteer as a mentor in a few Python live seminars organized by the CS50 staff at Harvard University.
                    This was a very unique experience as I did it in real-time when those seminars took place. I had to be quick in catching questions from the students
                    and answering them as there were a lot of students all around the world attending. It was quite an adrenaline rush! Everyone should get out of
                    their comfort zone every once in a while and take on new challenges.
